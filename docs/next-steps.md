# Next Steps 

- I think the most obvious thing is adding a separate class for bearded seals 
- Add yelps as a class 
- Try even shorter duration spectros
- Try adding multiple spectrogram representations for each image (look at most ideal for each site, and include that)
- Try adding noise and blur to the spectrograms 
- Make it so filtering is done before raven output 
- Talk to Sebastien and see if I've done the ensemble correctly, or more ideas for it
